        <h2>Age: 30</h2>
        <p>Today one of the most successful music stars in the world, Lady Gaga fast became a household name after the release of her first album, The Fame , in 2008. This biography charts this remarkable young woman's rise to the very summit of musical superstardom, covering her early years at a Roman Catholic school in Manhattan, her first forays into music writing and performing, her early struggles to find a break in an industry that didn't initially appreciate her abilities, her eventual breakthrough, her philanthropic work and, of course, her look. It discusses how she is noted as much for her flamboyant dress sense and extravagant live performances as her undoubted musical ability, fascinating fans and critics alike. Comparing her to the glam rock entertainers David Bowie and Queen, this book discusses how Gaga is unlike any other musician performing today, and charts how such singularity has won her numerous accolades, including five Grammy Awards and 13 MTV Video Music Awards, as well as being listed by Time magazine as one of the world's most influential people.</p>

        <h2>Age: 28</h2>
        <p>Miley Cyrus became an overnight sensation in 2006 as the lead of the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana, but as the years went on, she established herself as a pop star in her own right. Overnight popularity wasn't a new thing for the Cyrus family; Miley's father, country singer Billy Ray Cyrus, went from obscurity to stardom in a few short months in 1992, when "Achy Breaky Heart" became a crossover hit. The success of "Achy Breaky Heart" was hardly the only memorable event for Billy Ray that year, though, as he and his wife welcomed their daughter Destiny Hope Cyrus into the world on November 23, 1992. Destiny's cheerful disposition as a child earned her the nickname Smiley, which stuck when it was shortened to Miley. </p>
